## My process
1. I started with creating the HTML structure, then when I was done I went ahead with creating the base styling with internal CSS where I used the CSS grid to determine how the QR-code div would be placed on the screen, then I styles the image to give it a responsive style, then I worked on the QR-code div which was holding the qr-image and the two paragraphs. Then I styled the different paragraphs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to use the css min() function.

I am proud of this code

.qr{
      width: min(100%, 20rem);
    }

### Continued development

I would love to take on more challenges that will improve my css responsive game
